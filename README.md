### **What our project is about:**

## RateMyGym is a web application where users can provide ratings and comments about local gyms regarding many factors
such as price, availability of equipment, location, and general environment. RatingMyGym has been built in collaboration
with Ruby on Rails but following Object-Oriented guidelines of the MVC architecture. The minimum increased features for 
security of a login system are implemented, along with a future User Profile page where users will be able to update their
 account information and update their activity. When the user chooses a gym and leaves a review, the system will add this
 new review to the creation of the general rating of the gym and the breakdown of reviews for certain ones, since the users
 can visualize aggregated ratings for factors such as machines, staff, cleanliness, atmosphere, etc. The frontend provides 
 an intuitive interface done via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; the backend manages user authentication, data storage, and the
 dynamic showing of information and reviews regarding the gym in a very efficient way. PostgreSQL is used for database management, 
 and best practices were followed in development, including feature tracking and version control through GitHub.
